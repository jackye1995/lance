# Installation

The easiest way to use Lance is to install its Python SDK `pylance`.
You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pylance
```

For the latest features and bug fixes, you can install the preview version:

```bash
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/ pylance
```

Preview releases receive the same level of testing as regular releases.
